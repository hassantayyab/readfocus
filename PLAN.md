# ReadFocus App Development Roadmap

## üìñ App Summary

**ReadFocus** is a student-focused reading companion app that helps users maintain attention and improve comprehension. It is built for students who struggle with focus (especially those with ADD/ADHD) and often find themselves zoning out, rereading lines, or failing to understand material.

Unlike distraction blockers (like Forest) or speed-reading tools (like Bionic Reading, BeeLine, or Speechify), **ReadFocus combines guided reading, active comprehension checks, and gamification** to transform passive reading into active learning.

**Main Value Proposition:**

- Stay engaged with text through chunked reading and pacing.
- Prevent zoning out with quick comprehension checks ("Did you get it?").
- Reinforce learning through recall prompts and gamified streaks.
- Support both digital (websites, PDFs) and physical text (via OCR snapshot).
